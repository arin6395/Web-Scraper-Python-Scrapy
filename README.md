# Web Scraper Python Scrapy
This repo includes spiders for going through various websites and scrap desired information. For eg. DTM_scraper goes through all the web pages on the specified domain (www.mercedes-benz.com/en just for example) and pull out the DTM (adobe Dynamic Tag Manager) header code. We can simple run the spider using 'scrapy runspider' in terminal.
